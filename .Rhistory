# while a messy graph, this shows several things:
#1.) blue etel does have a seasonal pattern, but is mostly not growing in the amount exported
#2.) red etel is highly seasonal, and the trend is increasing.  The amount exported is nearly triple the value in 2008 seasonally
#3.) Total etel follows that same trend as red etel, and is only decremented by the minor impact of blue etel.  Blue etel does not appear to be nearly as popular.  It could also be more scarce.
#4.) EFAK has the strongest growth of all.  While seasonal, the seasonal fluctuations are not nearly as strong as etel
#5.) Wuge is strong as well and closely mimics efac
#6.) Total exports are growing and have definite seasonal trends

## WEll, it looks like a bit of a draw as to which model to pick from the standpoint of MAPE, MPE, AIC, and BIC.
## The parsimony principle would recommend that we go with the simplest model.  In this case, perhaps the additive is simpler to explain, but the implementation is not any different
